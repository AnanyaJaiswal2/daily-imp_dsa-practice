# daily-imp_dsa-practice
Daily practice of important DSA problems in C++ with multiple approaches (Brute, Better, Optimal) and complexity analysis. Tracking my consistency and preparing for coding interviews.

| # | Problem | Approaches | Complexities |
## Arrays
| 1 | Majority Element | Brute, Better, Optimal | Brute O(n^2), Better O(n), Optimal O(n) | 
| 2 | Find Missing and Repeated Values | Brute (map) | O(n^2), O(n^2) |
| 3 | Single Number | XOR method | O(n), O(1) |
| 4 | Kadane's Algorithm (Max Subarray Sum) | Dynamic Programming (Kadaneâ€™s) | O(n), O(1) |
| 5 | Merge Two Sorted Arrays | Two Pointer Approach | O(n+m), O(1) |
| 6 | Stock Buy and Sell | Greedy | O(n), O(1) |
| 7 | Two Odd Occurring Numbers | Hashmap (unordered_map) | O(n), O(n) |
