# daily-imp_dsa-practice
Daily practice of important DSA problems in C++ with multiple approaches (Brute, Better, Optimal) and complexity analysis. Tracking my consistency and preparing for coding interviews.

| # | Problem | Approaches | Complexities |
## Arrays
| 1 | Majority Element | Brute, Better, Optimal | Brute O(n^2), Better O(n), Optimal O(n) | 
| 2 | Find Missing and Repeated Values | Brute (map) | O(n^2), O(n^2) |
