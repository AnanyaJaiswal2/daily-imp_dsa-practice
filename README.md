# daily-imp_dsa-practice
Daily practice of important DSA problems in C++ with multiple approaches (Brute, Better, Optimal) and complexity analysis. Tracking my consistency and preparing for coding interviews.

| Problem | Topic  | Approaches | Complexities |
## Day 1 (2025-08-18)
| Majority Element | Arrays | Brute, Better, Optimal (Mooreâ€™s Voting) | Brute O(n^2), Better O(n), Optimal O(n) | 
| Find Missing and Repeated Values | Arrays (2D) | Brute Force (map) | O(n^2), O(n^2) |
