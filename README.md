# daily-imp_dsa-practice
Daily practice of important DSA problems in C++ with multiple approaches (Brute, Better, Optimal) and complexity analysis. Tracking my consistency and preparing for coding interviews.

## Arrays
| # | Problem | Approaches | Complexities |
|---|----------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | Majority Element | Brute, Better, Optimal | O(n^2), O(n), O(n) |
| 2 | Find Missing and Repeated Values | Brute | O(n^2) |
| 3 | Single Number | Bit Manipulation | O(n), O(1) |
| 4 | Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm | Kadane | O(n), O(1) |
| 5 | Merge Two Sorted Arrays | Two Pointers | O(n+m), O(1) |
| 6 | Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock II | Greedy | O(n), O(1) |
| 7 | Two Odd Occurring Numbers | Hashmap | O(n), O(n) |
| 8 | Power(x,n) | Binary Exponentiation | O(log n), O(1) |
| 9 | Container With Most Water | Two Pointers | O(n), O(1) |
| 10 | Sort 0s, 1s, 2s (Dutch Flag) | 3 Pointers | O(n), O(1) |
| 11 | 3Sum | Sorting + Two Pointers | O(n^2), O(1) |
| 12 | 4Sum | Sorting + Two Pointers | O(n^3), O(1) |
| 13 | Search in 2D Matrix | Binary Search | O(n+m), O(1) |
| 14 | Find Duplicate Number | Brute, Better, Optimal (Tortoise-Hare) TODO | O(n log n), O(n), O(1) |

## Binary Search
| # | Problem | Approaches | Complexities |
|---|----------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | Single Element in Sorted Array | Binary Search on pairs | O(log n), O(1) |
| 2 | Peak Element | Binary Search | O(log n), O(1) |
| 3 | Search in Rotated Sorted Array | Modified Binary Search | O(log n), O(1) |
